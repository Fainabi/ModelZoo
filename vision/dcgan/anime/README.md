# Anime-Gan

DCGAN for anime icon generation. The dataset downloaded at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces), origined from [www.getchu.com](www.getchu.com).

Some generated characters were added to `output` directory. These characters were generated from a fixed vector of noises. One can observe some mode collapse and distortion problems, of the vanilla GAN.
