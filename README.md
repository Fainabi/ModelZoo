# Model Zoo
This is a repository for learning Flux.jl and some ML/DL technologies, as well as ReinforcementLearning.jl. One can find some mature models in Flux's [model-zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo) repository. Framework of reinforcement learning is from [ReinforcementLeraning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl), and some algorihms from [ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl).
