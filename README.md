# Model Zoo of ML in Flux.jl and ReinforcementLearning.jl
This is a repository for learning Flux.jl and some ML/DL technologies. One can find some mature models in Flux's [model-zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo) repository. Framework of reinforcement learning is from [ReinforcementLeraning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl), and some algorihms from [ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl).


# Implemented Models

- Vision
  - Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

- RL
  - K-Armed Bandits
