# MelodyRNN

[MelodyRNN](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/melody_rnn) is proposed by [magenta](https://github.com/magenta/magenta), a research project started by Google Brain team. It generates melody using RNN models, and thus produces so-called _Basic_, _Mono_, _Lookback_ and _Attention_ RNNs for melody generation.

The basic of melody generation can be learnt about with the videos in youtube from [Valerio Velardo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNr0KMutwtbeDCmpwvtul-Xz). I was learning from that and trained a simple LSTM based melody generator.
