# Music Generation

Here we will explorer some famous models of music generation, in symbolic domain and audio domain. They are

- Symbolic Domain
  - MelodyRNN
  - MidiNet

- Audio Domain


## Dataset Preparation

The existing dataset are all of melody pieces, complete midi melody, and complete songs in various form. The following dataset are used. Some of the datasets are not easy to be crawled down, due to their event-handling on the website. Fortunately, some other sources can be accessed, e.g. wayne391's [symbolic music datasets](https://github.com/wayne391/symbolic-music-datasets) git repository, thanks to these guys' nice works.
